# Garticphone Bot

Draw an image from a png file in the game [Garticphone](https://garticphone.com/de). Currently made so that it creates a lobby for itself, but will be more configurable in the future.

Using selenium webdriver.  

## Current State

### Bigger Images:

Result after 2h(Did not finish):

The program exited accidentally after pressing outside the canvas on the finish button. This issue is not fixed yet.

### Pixel Art examples:

These generally work better and are way faster(Around 3-4min). The only issue is that the background detection does sometimes screw the image over, when the actuall background is not the most prevellent color.

## Roadmap
- Fix the bug where program accidentally finishes early
- Optimize Drawing.(2h for a 480x218 image is way too much)
- Add more options to use the bot:
  - Join lobbies
  - Ease of use

## How to use
I would not recommend using this project at the current state, as it is still to impractical to use for anything other than novelty. However, I intend on making the program more usable in the future.
